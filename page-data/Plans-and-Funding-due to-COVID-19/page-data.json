With a focus of creating possibilities for their children with disabilities, a group of parents formed Intelife in 1991. Starting with a team of seven providing activities and work opportunities to 24 school leavers, Intelife recognised a wider need for outcome-focused disability programs and services. This led to the creation of a broader employment service in 1993, followed by the development of Intelife’s community access and engagement program in 1996.</p>\n<p>Creating lives filled with possibilities\nOver the years, Intelife has developed a full range of programs and services including School Leaver support, Lifeskills programs and Employment Opportunities programs including our Supported Employment program, as well as Respite Services. Our innovative programs are tailored provide real choice and flexibility, supporting people to achieve their goals and dreams. We build relationships which place the individual at the centre of all decision making, working together to plan a journey to independence.</p>\n<p>Today, Intelife’s team is proud to work with over 650 individuals across Perth and the South West of Australia, empowering them to live a life without boundaries – a life they are proud of.</p>","excerpt":"A proud history of enabling independence\nIntelife is driven by a commitment to…"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"Plans-and-Funding-due to-COVID-19"}}}
